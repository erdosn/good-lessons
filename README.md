# GOOD LESSONS
I have waaaaay too many lessons on all of the topics on our courses here at Flatiron! 

So, I decided to store the good ones. The ones that really drove points home into this repo. I highly recommend you just clone this repo as is and you can pull any changes I make to it. :)

# HOW TO USE
* You can fork and clone this repo if you want, but that means if I make changes you won't be able to pull them into the repo
* You can clone this repo as is into your local
	* The benefit of this is you can pull changes
	* But you cannot push any changes that you make because you don't have those permissions, so just keep that in mind.
* If you 'borrow' any of my code for anything, please cite it. That's all I ask. :) 
* Now if you learn the code and reformat it for yourself that's different. Your code has been inspired and you don't always have to cite your inspirations.


# Enjoy!!!!
